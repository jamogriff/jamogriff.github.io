# My Relationship with Music

Perhaps the most illuminating details lie in early childhood. Before the age of 7 I compulsively listened to my parent's [Mannheim Steamroller album]("https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xg5qBbleK0w") and the Rusted Root song ["Send Me on My Way"]("https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGMabBGydC0"). This obsession with specific songs peaked when I heard Grieg's ["In the Hall of the Mountain King"]("https://youtu.be/kLp_Hh6DKWc") a couple years later and thankfully I was able to channel this interest into learning instruments and eventually found my voice through the guitar many, many years later.
