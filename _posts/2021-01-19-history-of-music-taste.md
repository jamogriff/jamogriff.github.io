<h3 style='font-family: "Abril Fatface", serif;'>When it comes to music, I've been pretty "on the spectrum"...</h3>

Before the age of 7 I compulsively listened to my parent's **[Mannheim Steamroller album](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xg5qBbleK0w)** and the Rusted Root song *__["Send Me on My Way"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGMabBGydC0)__*. This obsession with specific songs peaked when I heard Grieg's *__["In the Hall of the Mountain King"](https://youtu.be/kLp_Hh6DKWc)__* where I probably listened to it ten times a day for a couple of months. **[Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross' rendition](https://youtu.be/TPZtigbbkz4)** for *The Social Network* soundtrack is also ðŸ‘ŒI still enjoy instrumental music a lot these days. Patrick O'Hearn's *__["Beyond this Moment"](https://youtu.be/v_nWBzeWQW4)__* and Erik WÃ¸llo's *__["Sedona"](https://youtu.be/bIDTK33YH44)__* are just my vibe.

After a pretty intense Weird Al stage, my first *"real"* album was Franz Ferdinand's self-titled. I'm notoriously bad at memorizing lyrics, but I listened to this album so much that I know the words not only to their hit *__["Take Me Out"](https://youtu.be/Ijk4j-r7qPA)__*, but to the entire album.

For better or worse, my teenage years consisted of entirely indie music-- *whatever the hell that means.* Modest Mouse was tops though. *__["Lounge (Closing Time)"](https://youtu.be/muAwTA2XCVA)__* and *__["Spitting Venom"](https://youtu.be/-eifPUvi7kA)__* are two of my faves.

My twenties consisted of a lot of hip-hop, of far more artists than I can name. What an absolutely inventive and varied genre of music. If I had to pick some of my favorites off the top of my head they would be *__["Exhibit A"](https://youtu.be/nJI2ExhhQCs)__* by Jay Electronica and Kanye West's **My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy** album.

At some point during this time I had a couple of transformational music experiences:
1. Hearing this guy's acoustic cover of The White Stripe's *__["Ball and Biscuit"](https://youtu.be/30tTcvQCLy8)__* which got me into the blues.
2. Going to a Steel Panther and Judas Priest concert with "Turkey" and Ashlee which opened my eyes and ears to glorious metal ðŸ¤˜

**As I enter my thirties those two genres are what really resonate with me.** They are both very rhythm-centric and many songs are played in the best key (E). So many great riffs were written in E...
