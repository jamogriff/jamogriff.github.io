<p>
  My interests are numerous, but the ones that really get me excited are music
  and technology.
</p>

<h3>Tech</h3>
<p>
  From an early age I was captivated by technology and took apart every
  electronic device I could find. Today I practice that same fascination through
  <a href="https://go.jamison.codes/repos">software development</a>. Whether
  it's consulting or a personal project, I'm typically cooking up something and
  keep a <a href="{{ base.url }}/worklog">worklog</a> that documents my weekly
  progress. It's a safe bet you can find me geeking out about software and
  design on <a href="https://go.jamison.codes/twitter">Twitter</a> and my
  <a href="{{ base.url }}/programming">programming blog</a>.
</p>

<h3>Music</h3>
<p>
  Piano jazz standards, acoustic blues, and heavy metal electric guitar riffs
  all feed my soul. I have a humble studio and when I have long stretches of
  free time I'll record and
  <a href="https://go.jamison.codes/music">produce my own music</a>. Typically I
  don't have the patience for production, so I occasionally post unedited
  musical snippets on my
  <a href="https://go.jamison.codes/youtube">YouTube channel</a>.
</p>

<h3>Misc</h3>
<p>
  I've always been fond of writing, but have not yet made a conscious effort to
  practice it consistently. <a href="{{ base.url }}/musings">My musings</a> are
  a space to grow that skill more and posts may feature anything under the large
  umbrella of my interests.
</p>
