<p> My interests are numerous, but the ones that really get me excited are music and technology.</p>

<h3>Tech</h3>
<p>From an early age I was captivated by technology and took apart every electronic device I could find. Today I practice that same fascination through <a href="https://github.com/jamogriff">software development</a>. Whether it's consulting or a personal project, I'm typically cooking up something and keep a <a href="{{ base.url }}/worklog">worklog</a> that documents my weekly progress. It's a safe bet you can find me geeking out about software and design on <a href="https://twitter.com/jamogriff">Twitter</a> and my <a href="{{ base.url }}/programming">programming blog</a>.</p>

<h3>Music</h3>
<p>Piano jazz standards, acoustic blues, and heavy metal electric guitar riffs all feed my soul. I have a humble studio and when I have long stretches of free time I'll record and <a href="https://soundcloud.com/jamogriff">produce my own music</a>. Typically I don't have the patience for production, so I occasionally post unedited musical snippets on my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCu-LxByEm3Jctawf_phklXA">YouTube channel</a>.</p>

<h3>Misc</h3>
<p>I've always been fond of writing, but have not yet made a conscious effort to practice it consistently. <a href="{{ base.url }}/musings">My musings</a> are a space to grow that skill more and posts may feature anything under the large umbrella of my interests.</p>
