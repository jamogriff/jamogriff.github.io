<p> My interests are numerous, but the ones that really get me geeking out are music and technology.</p>

<h3>Tech</h3>
<p>From an early age I was captivated by technology and took apart every electronic device I could find. Today I practice that same fascination through software development. Whether it's consulting of a personal project, I'm typically cooking up something and I keep a <a href="{{ base.url }}/worklog">worklog</a> that documents my weekly goals and progress. It's a safe bet you can find me geeking out about software and more on <a href="https://twitter.com/jamogriff">Twitter</a> and my <a href="{{ base.url }}/blog/tech">tech blog</a>.</p>

<h3>Music</h3>
<p>Piano jazz standards, acoustic blues, and heavy metal electric guitar riffs all feed my soul. I have a humble studio and when I have long stretches of free time I'll record and <a href="#">produce my own music</a>.</p>

<strong>Thanks for stopping by!</strong><p>Check out my <a href="{{ base.url }}/blog">blog</a> for my musings or find me on <a href="#">Telegram</a> if you'd like to chat.</p>
