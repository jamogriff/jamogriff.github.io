I'm enthusiastic about a lot of things. Photography, travel, music, skiing, kayaking, basketball, tennis, yoga, anatomy, film, and video games are some topics that jump out at me. I've always been fond of writing, but have not made a conscious effort to practice it consistently; these posts are the small beginnings of that goal.
