![Grand Tetons in the Mirror]({{ base.url }}/assets/images/travel/teton-mirror.jpg "Grand Tetons in the mirror")

I'm enthusiastic about a lot of things. Photography, travel, music, skiing, kayaking, basketball, tennis, yoga, anatomy, film, and video games are some topics that jump out at me. [My Twitter](https://twitter.com/jamogriff) acts a sieve for most of these thoughts, but the ones worth developing live here. I've always been fond of writing, but have not made a conscious effort to practice it consistently; these posts are the small beginnings of that goal.
