Programming has been, and continues to be, a long and remarkable journey for me. Periodically I get an itch to flex my technical writing skills and post code walkthroughs and challenges here. I have a background in philosophy and design, so I enjoy tying in the *why* of things as well as noteworthy design whenever I can.
