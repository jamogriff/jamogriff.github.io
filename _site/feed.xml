&lt;p&gt;But if I were French I don‚Äôt think I could stand the tourists. Never have I been in a another country where tourists so readily disregard a country‚Äôs native tongue. During a dinner at a brasserie by the Trocadero I witnessed the &lt;em&gt;typical American tourist&lt;/em&gt; and I could feel nothing but embarrassment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;‚ÄúYou got any bourbon?‚Äù &lt;em&gt;He drawled in lazy English as the waiter looked baffled.&lt;/em&gt;
‚ÄúYou know, BURR-BUN WISS-KEY.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He made an off-hand comment about the French people as he shooed away the poor waiter with his wine-list. It felt like such a stark contrast in experience as I enjoyed a superb meal that was made with pride. The steak was beautifully seared and basted; the fries, hand-cut and cooked to perfection. Even the humble side salad was composed of the freshest butter lettuce I‚Äôve ever eaten. The waiter (who was patient with my garbage French) recommended the best pairing of wine that I still dream about to this day‚Äì a red Brouilly ü•∞&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along the northern coast lies a small picturesque town called Etretat. Kelsie and I picked a small seafood restaurant for dinner and were sat next to another tourist couple. At this point of the trip we had been in France for a little over a week, and I could speak enough French to not rely on English at all in a restaurant‚Äì even if I had to count on my fingers to remember &lt;em&gt;cinq&lt;/em&gt; is five üòÖ As I enjoyed my delicious sole meuniere, our tourist neighbors took out their phone for the waitress and were insistently pointing to a picture of a lobster. Needless to say, the waitress was incredibly confused‚Äì it wasn‚Äôt on the menu or even remotely native to the area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suppose travel only broadens the mind if one allows him/herself to be open to another‚Äôs culture.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="travelogue" /><summary type="html">There‚Äôs a misconception that the French are rude‚Ä¶</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Expo Voting App</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/projects/2021/01/21/web-voting-app.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Expo Voting App" /><published>2021-01-21T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2021-01-21T00:00:00-07:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/projects/2021/01/21/web-voting-app</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/projects/2021/01/21/web-voting-app.html">&lt;h1 id=&quot;vote-and-tally&quot;&gt;Vote and tally&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most illuminating details lie in early childhood. Before the age of 7 I compulsively listened to my parent‚Äôs &lt;a href=&quot;&amp;quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xg5qBbleK0w&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;Mannheim Steamroller album&lt;/a&gt; and the Rusted Root song &lt;a href=&quot;&amp;quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGMabBGydC0&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;‚ÄúSend Me on My Way‚Äù&lt;/a&gt;. This obsession with specific songs peaked when I heard Grieg‚Äôs &lt;a href=&quot;&amp;quot;https://youtu.be/kLp_Hh6DKWc&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;‚ÄúIn the Hall of the Mountain King‚Äù&lt;/a&gt; a couple years later and thankfully I was able to channel this interest into learning instruments and eventually found my voice through the guitar many, many years later.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Jamison</name></author><category term="music" /><summary type="html">My Relationship with Music</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Welcome to Jekyll!</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/projects/2021/01/17/welcome-to-jekyll.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Welcome to Jekyll!" /><published>2021-01-17T15:28:44-07:00</published><updated>2021-01-17T15:28:44-07:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/projects/2021/01/17/welcome-to-jekyll</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/projects/2021/01/17/welcome-to-jekyll.html">&lt;p&gt;You‚Äôll find this post in your &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;_posts&lt;/code&gt; directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;jekyll serve&lt;/code&gt;, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;YEAR&lt;/code&gt; is a four-digit number, &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;MONTH&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;DAY&lt;/code&gt; are both two-digit numbers, and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;MARKUP&lt;/code&gt; is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot; data-lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;print_hi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;puts&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;Hi, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;#{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;print_hi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'Tom'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;#=&amp;gt; prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
