<h1 style="font-family: &quot;Abril Fatface&quot;, serif;">There's a misconception that the French are rude...</h1>

<p><strong>‚Ä¶ but if I were French I don‚Äôt think I could stand the tourists.</strong></p>

<p>Never have I been in a another country where tourists so readily disregard a country‚Äôs native tongue. During a dinner at a brasserie by the Trocad√©ro in Paris I witnessed the <em>typical American tourist</em> and I could feel nothing but embarrassment.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>‚ÄúYou got any bourbon?‚Äù <em>He drawled in lazy English as the waiter looked baffled.</em></p>

  <p>‚ÄúYou know, BURR-BUN WISS-KEY!‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He made an off-hand comment about the French people as he shooed away the poor waiter with his wine-list. It felt like such a stark contrast in experiences as I enjoyed a superb meal that was made with pride. The steak was beautifully seared and basted; the fries, hand-cut and cooked to perfection. Even the humble side salad was composed of the freshest butter lettuce I‚Äôve ever eaten. The waiter (who was patient with my garbage French) recommended the best pairing of wine that I still dream about to this day‚Äì a red Brouilly ü•∞</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/etretat.jpg" alt="Shoreline of √âtretat" title="Shoreline of √âtretat" />
Along the northern coast lies a small picturesque town called √âtretat. Kelsie and I picked a small seafood restaurant for dinner and were sat next to another tourist couple. At this point of the trip we had been in France for a little over a week, and I could speak enough French to not rely on English at all in a restaurant‚Äì even if I had to count on my fingers to remember <em>cinq</em> is five üòÖ As I enjoyed my delicious sole meuni√®re, our tourist neighbors took out their phone for the waitress and were insistently pointing to a picture of a lobster. Needless to say, the waitress was incredibly confused‚Äì it wasn‚Äôt on the menu or even remotely native to the area.</p>

<p><em><strong>I suppose travel only broadens the mind insofar as one allows him/herself to be open to another‚Äôs culture.</strong></em></p>
