# Personal Website Project

This project utilized Jekyll to generate a static site to use for my own purposes. This served as a great introduction to trying out a couple new technologies, specifically:
- Hosting a page using GitHub Pages
- Utilizing Jekyll for site generation

### I'll return to document further on this project and my thoughts on Jekyll in general-- in short, it's awesome.
