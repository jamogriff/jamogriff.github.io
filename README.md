# Personal Website

This is site is built with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and features an [open source theme](https://github.com/jamogriff/gruv-poole) and [plugin](https://github.com/jamogriff/jekyll-cleansing-rite) that I developed.

This was originally created in 2020, sat dormant for three years and then revived and overhauled in 2024. I've wanted to build a proper personal website since 2009, and have attempted and fizzled out more than half a dozen times. Let this stand as a humble monument to the virtue of persistence.
