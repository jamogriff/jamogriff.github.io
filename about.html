<h2>I was born in a small Colorado town long ago...</h2>

<p>Long ago is relative I suppose. Despite the misleading picture I did, in fact, grow up with electricity. I took full advantage of this good fortune by taking apart any electronic device I could get my hands on, watching <b><i>Star Wars</i></b> and playing <b><i>The Legend of Zelda</i></b>.</p>
<h4>Fast forward a couple of heart-warming and slightly awkward decades later...</h4>

<p>I would describe myself as a life-long learner who enjoys to deep-dive on whatever topic sparks my interest. As enriching as learning is, I find teaching to be more rewarding. Throughout my career, from healthcare to higher-ed, I've always gotten great joy out of seeing a student grasp a new topic. Currently I spend my time <a href="/api-docs">building out my own API</a>, playing music, and going on adventures with my best friend and fianc√©e.
