        Jamison Griffith is a full-stack developer based out of Arvada Colorado. In 2015 he graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in Integrative Biology at CU Denver. After working a couple of years as a medial writer and a clinical microbiology lab tech he began exploring ways to pivot to programming.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 2018, he accepted a role as Senior Prototyping Specialist for the interdisciplinary Inworks lab at CU Denver. He worked with physicians to 3D-print novel anatomical models, provided prototyping services for entrepreneurs during the <a href="https://101010.net">10.10.10 startup program</a> and developed a web app to allow staff to manage the lab access and credentials of more than 600 users.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <p>
     All said and done, he taught more than 180 Inworks workshops in 3D-printing, laser-cutting, programming, electronics, <abbr title="Computer Numerical Control">CNC</abbr> milling, and 3D <abbr title="Computer Assisted Design">CAD</abbr> design to undergraduate/graduate students and professionals.
    </p>
    <p>
      He enrolled in the Backend Engineering program at the <a href="https://turing.edu/">Turing School of Software and Design</a> in 2021. Turing gave him the opportunity to learn the principles of <abbr title="Object Oriented Programming">OOP</abbr>, <abbr title="Test Driven Design">TDD</abbr> and <abbr title="Model View Controller">MVC</abbr> architecture and apply them on a half dozen projects for more than 40 hours a week for ~7 months.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <p>
      Later that year he began working at <a href="https://zingstudios.com/">Zing Studios</a> as a full-stack developer. Since then he has designed and built a data warehouse, implemented dozens of <abbr title="Application Programming Interfaces">API</abbr>s, launched custom eCommerce sites, and built state-driven frontend and admin applications for a SAAS product.
    </p>
    <p>
      He strives to write <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID">SOLID</a> and robust code that meet his clients' needs and deadlines. He's just as comfortable implementing interfaces on the backend as creating modular styles on the frontend. He can churn out a lot of code using just a Terminal, git and Docker.

      I would describe myself as a chillbilly hailing from the Four Corners region of Colorado. I enjoy reading, playing guitar, skiing, kayaking and fixing things around the house. During my twenties I was really into cooking and photography, so I would consider those my latent hobbies. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Out of all my hobbies I would consider playing guitar my most rewarding one. I dabble with a fair amount of other other instruments, but I've stuck with guitar for {{ site.time | time_since: 2011 }} years. Feel free to <a href="{{ base.url }}/songlist">check out the songs</a> I'm currently playing and trying to master (I mostly play acoustic).
    </p>

    <p>
      Some of my noteworthy achievements have been presenting in front of the Colorado Supreme Court in high school, being in the top 5% of my undergraduate five-credit human anatomy course and renovating an entire bathroom from the studs, wiring, drywall and tiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Currently I spend my time programming full-time, puttering around the house, and going on the occasional adventure with my best friend and wife, Kelsie.
