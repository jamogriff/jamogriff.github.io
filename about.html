Long ago is relative I suppose. Despite the misleading picture I did, in fact, grow up with electricity. I took full advantage of this good fortune by taking apart any electronic device I could get my hands on, watching <b><i>Star Wars</i></b> and playing <b><i>The Legend of Zelda</i></b>.

I would describe myself as a life-long learner who enjoys to deep-dive on whatever topic sparks my interest. As enriching as learning is, I find teaching to be more rewarding. Throughout my career, from healthcare to higher-ed, I've always gone the extra mile to teach others. Currently I spend my time learning the craft of web-development at <b><a href="https://turing.io">Turing</a></b>, playing guitar, and going on adventures with my best friend and fianc√©e.
